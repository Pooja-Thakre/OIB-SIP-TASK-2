Her relentless mission to work for the people and their livelihood is a fitting reminder that one can be the good they want to see in the world.

            "She is a renowned and a devoted social worker who focuses on prioritizing the lives of orphaned children. Her decision to look after orphaned children was triggered by her own life experiences. During her childhood Sindhutai went through phases where she missed having someone by her side. In one of her interviews she said that it was at such times that she realized what it meant to be abandoned. Having suffered thus, she made it her life’s mission to stand by needy and homeless children.",<strong style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"> Sindutai Sapkal </strong>,Her greatness and kind nature is reflected in one of her speeches. She said, ‘I am with everyone who has no other people to look after them’..
